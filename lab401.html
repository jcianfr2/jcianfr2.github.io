    <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Crochet</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do in my free time is crochet. I learned how to crochet about three years ago from watching tutorials on YouTube, and was instantly hooked! (That's a crochet pun, because the tools you use to crochet are hooks)</p>
    <h3>Things I Have Crocheted</h3>
    <p>Over the past three years I have crocheted many things. The first project I made was a beanie. It turned out pretty well, it's just to itcy for me to wear because I used very cheap yarn. 
      In my early days of crocheting, I also made a few tank tops, but I also never wear those because I couldn't get the sizing right at the time, so they are all either too big or too small. 
      However, one of the best first projects I made was a tote bag I crocheted for my friend for her birthday. She still uses it! Later that year, I decided to crochet all my family members beanies
      for Christmas. These beanies turned out a lot better than my very first beanie because I picked out super soft yarn and had really started to hone in my crochet skills. One of my most used projects
      I have made is my sunglasses case that I crocheted. I use it every day and it does a wonderful job of protecting my sunglasses when I want to throw them in my purse or backpack! I have crocheted 
      many other things, but the last thing I want to mention is the sweater I just finished making. It was by far my biggest project I have ever made, and took me months of working on it on and off to 
      complete. It is a bit too big on me (I still have trouble getting clothing sizes right), but I am very proud of it. </p>
